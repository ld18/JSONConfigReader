# JSONConfigReader
Simple jason configuration reader for a textfile based software configuration

Simple little praser which allows to fetch values from a config json. The json file must only be read once.
It is threadsafe and fail-fast written (there a get funktions with defauolt values). 
In branch Examples is an example project. It cant work with array (yet.. maybe).

Based on the JASON Parser from gregjesl (https://github.com/gregjesl/simpleson)
